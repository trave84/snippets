#Gulp by examples

Various Gulp configurations to serve as basis for your projects.

Expecting you have already installed _node.js_ and Gulp-cli `npm install -g gulp-cli` (as Administrator or with `sudo` on OSX/Linux). 

Always the same install with 

```
npm install
```

and run with 

```
gulp
```

(there may be more tasks to run, check descriptions for each config)


## 01-browserync

Browsersync automatically refreshing `.html` and `.css` files in root folder. 


## 02-scss

Same as 01 but also compiling `index.css` from Sass (scss) in `index.scss`. Generating sourcemaps too.
